I caught it bad yesterday
You hit with me with a call to your place
Ain't been out in a while anyway
Was hoping I could catch you throwin' smiles at my face

Romantic talking? You don't even have to try
You're cute enough to fuck with me tonight
Lookin' at the table all I see is weed and white
Baby you livin' the life but nigga you ain't living right

Cocaine and drinking with your friends
You live in the dark, boy, I cannot pretend
I'm not fazed, only here to sin
If Eve ain't in your garden, you know that you can

Call me when you want
Call me when you need
Call me in the morning
I'll be on the way

Call me when you want
Call me when you need
Call me out by your name
I'll be on the way, like

I wanna sell what you're buying
I wanna feel on your ass in Hawaii
I want that jet lag from fuckin' and flyin'
Shoot a child in your mouth while I'm ridin'

Oh, oh... Why me?
A sign of the times every time that I speak
A dime and a nine, it was mine every week
What a time, an incline, God was shining on me

Now I can't leave
And now I'm actin' hella elite
Never want the niggas that's in my league
I want to fuck the ones I envy (I envy)

Cocaine and drinking with your friends
You live in the dark, boy, I cannot pretend
I'm not fazed, only here to sin
If Eve ain't in your garden, you know that you can

Call me when you want
Call me when you need
Call me in the morning
I'll be on the way

Call me when you want
Call me when you need
Call me out by your name
I'll be on the way, like

Call me by your name
Tell me you love me in private
Call me by your name
I do not care if you're lying
